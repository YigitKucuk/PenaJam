## OVERVIEW
This is our project for Bilkent University CS102. Penajam is a mobile application where people interested in music can connect from all over the world to find their passion and meet with like-minded musicians. We do not only allow users to create their unique profile and be on display, but they can also share their posts and learn about recent news regarding music.
   
## FEATURES
**Easy Register and Login:**
Users can easily sign in using their social media accounts or create one within our application

**Welcoming Main Page:** 
Users can see recent posts or messages through the main screen where they can also navigate to the other screens. There is also a button for logging out.

**News:**
As a PenaJam user, you do not even need another application to check the recent music news. We have a seperate section where the most recent updated news feed is played so that the users can get to know about the music industry.

**Posts:** 
In PenaJam, any user can see other posts or create one if he/she wants to. This helps our beloved musicians to find suitable people for their interests and connect with them. Here can also directly send a message to the owner of a post.

**Chat:**
Speaking of connections, your messages sent via our chat functionality are completely private! In chat page, you can see the recent list of people who have sent you a message or you have talked to.

**List of Users:** 
Struggling to find new people? Try to see the list of recent users from our users page where you can see their profile details or you can just send a message. Here users can also rate each others' profiles by giving stars to them.

**Profile and Settings:** 
Every user in our application can edit their profile data through settings or add information such as played instruments, description or location. This is your chance to make some sound, so make sure you use it the right way ^^
