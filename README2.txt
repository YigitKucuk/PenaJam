Title: PenaJam 

Description: PenaJam is an android application which allows musicians to share posts looking for band-members or apply for band auditions, look through music related events and chat with each other through private chatrooms. 

The project's current status: Our application is mainly done but we are adding and improving some of our functionality, we can say that it’s %80 done. 

What has been done (Works/ doesn’t work/ remaining): Registering and logging in is available, it is possible to post an audition and apply for it. You can see your own profile and edit it via settings. There is a chat working but we haven’t made it private just yet. The functions we implemented are working smoothly but there are some features that remain to be done such as fetching data from the internet for displaying music-related events, making our chatroom private and small touchups.
