To start with, there are a lot of things that were essentially new for all of us. These mainly include regular meetings, team ethics and consistent development process. We all learned how to communicate, plan and act as a team. Also, code development and documentation tasks taught us some essential skills required to be computer engineers.

Although there were not any particular parts of the project that we disliked as a group, we had some difficulties during the development. First one of them would be communication issues where our schedules would not allow us to meet as much as we wanted to. Even though we tried to solve these by not meeting but through texts or calls, they did not quite replace real-time meetings. Second difficulty that we all faced was the requirement of constantly researching and learning new skills. For example, most of our members had their very first experience with Android Studio which eventually took us quite a lot of time to explore and figure out.

If we were given a chance to somehow start over, we would probably try to do more research in advance so that we could better estimate the time and effort needed. It would also allow us to divide the project work based on the knowledge of group members and their schedules. Other than that, we could perhaps arrange more fact-to-face meetings to discuss things and code as a group. It would let everyone speak out during the meetings more easily and stay motivated during the project.

In general, we all tried to dedicate as much as we can to this project indlucing both time and effort. All group members actively participated in the weekly meetings and project development activities. That is why we can all say that we are really proud that a group of 5 random developers came together to develop an idea like this and implement it. There is always room for improvements, but we can firmly say that we have achieved a lot during this short period of time.
